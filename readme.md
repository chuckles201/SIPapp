Here, i will be making a simple VOIP application that allows for simplicity, understanding, and packet-level control.

The key parts are:
- ```SIP (session inition protocol)```: standard protocol to iniatiate/end a call
- ```RTP (real-time transport protocol)```: protocol to transport audio (or other) packets during a call
- simple GUI that allows for easy manipulation of SIP
