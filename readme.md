This is a work in progress attempt to make a simple VOIP (voice over IP) application.

The key parts are:
- ```SIP (session inition protocol)```: standard protocol to iniatiate/end a call
- ```RTP (real-time transport protocol)```: protocol to transport audio (or other) packets during a call
- simple GUI that allows for easy manipulation of SIP
