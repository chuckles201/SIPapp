    "## Pt 1. What is  SIP?\n",
    "\n",
    "SIP is the standard protocol used to intiate calls. SIP requests can be sent locally, or to a provider, who will forward your request to a phone remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SIP, we:\n",
    "- Specify 'to' and 'from' adress\n",
    "- Register with a server (for them to dispatch calls to public switching telephone network (PSTN))\n",
    "- Negotiate type of call that will be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start exploring the fundamentals of SIP, by building a local app that can both receive incoming calls, and make outbound calls, to IP adresses listening for UDP connections on the standardized SIP port. Then, we will send and receive SIP requests from a SIP trunk provider, who is that gateway which sends our SIP requests to PSTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be abstracting/treating as a black box:\n",
    "- UDP transport via wifi, and the entire wireless protocol/internet stack\n",
    "\n",
    "and focusing on the actual message that we send Via this transport, and exactly how it works/what it expects in order to establish/terminate calls both over local internet, and over the public internet. After this, we'll deal with the transport of audio packets."

    "## Pt.2 Implementing Basic SIP flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what a basic SIP request looks like, so we can build it from scratch. First, we will intiate a local call, sending an SIP INVITE from one machine on LAN to another. Usually things are not this easy; we forward the SIP request to some PBX or switching system; but we'll do this for simplicity now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the full request in text-form: [calls.ipynb](calls.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do a call from linphone (popular SIP caller), we can see the exact packets sent via UDP using wireshark(analyze-sip-follow)\n",
    "\n",
    "and here is a useful visual diagram that Wireshark provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "![callflow](callflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "### Theory/Bakground\n",
    "Ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's look at this as if we'd wanted to invent a protcol that allows calling to be done over the internet. Bascially, we are using the existing internet infrastrucutre, and IP protocols to \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Negotiate a call (what SIP does!)\n",
    "2. Send audio packets remotely\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the internet, and wireless transmission has become so fast that this is feasible, now the standardized way of communication just needs to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to design a minimal application that leverages IP and internet inferastructure to make calls, we would need to adhere to a couple of things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization: the computer needs to know how to read the bytes we send (ie special-byte seperated commands) every time.\n",
    "- Convey the right amount of information (IE the parameters in our request)\n",
    "\n",
    "So we could imagine sending a packet of bytes seperated by some special byte in-between each command, that desribes who is calling, and where its going to. (arrows are comments)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CALL --> Type of command\n",
    "Unique_ID: 1023fsndlfjn123 --> Unique call ID\n",
    "From:<person>@<ip_addr> --> After 'From', read who it is\n",
    "Audio:1 --> After 'Audio:' read T/F\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we could just create a listener that waits, parses, and responds according to our made-up protocl.\n",
